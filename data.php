1. Email for the short requirement estimation of having a range.

Hello Aru,

I went over the requirement and here is a general range for what you are looking at:

PHP App: 130-180 Hrs
1. User Registration & authentication.
2. Creating/Editing todo list.
3. Creating/Edding  todo items in each todo list
4. Import a predefined todo list.

Mobile App: 170-240 Hrs
1. User Registration & authentication.
2. Creating/Editing todo list.
3. Creating/Edding  todo items in each todo list
4. Import a predefined todo list.

There are lots of assumptions here. We are assuming you need to create <All the assumption goes here>

With the $9/hr rate, you can see the range of $100 - $120 for the PHP and 
$500-$700 for mobile App. Something like this could be done in 2-3 Weeks in PHP and 4-6 weeks in Andriod.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you want to pursue the idea further.

2. Email for the Long requirement estimation of having a sheet assocaited.

Hi Aru,
We have completed the estimation you have given us based on the documents. We only had 3 things to get confirmation on:
1. 
2. 
3. 

Ok if we assuming that <Assumtion goes here>

If you have any questions about the estimate please let me know. Most likely we would resource 2 developers for this. So the sprint velocity for to each 2 Week cycle will be about 160 hours. We would see if we could ramp up faster and possibly get that closer to 180 hours.

Design for this would depend completely on what you want it to look like. I would suggest building a UI kit and not an end to end design since the app could very easily be changed in the future. In this case, we would design a set of buttons, typography group and design elements that can easily be moved around/swapped out to create whatever page you needed. Like I described over the phone design hours billed at $50/hr.  Generally, a UI kit will take 10-30 hours depending on how much feedback we get. An end to end design would take a little bit more. I would need to see the list of sites that you like and would like to replicate first. If you need a logo designed first then I would add  $80-$100 (8-10 hours).
